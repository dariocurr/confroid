# Confroid
## About the project

### Introduction
Our project consists of two applications:
- Confroid:
is an app that manages files, more specifically
has the task to export or import configuration files from the device or from a server.
- Shopping:
is an app where to insert data relating to purchases, 
has the task of creating those configuration files through entered personal data by an user.

## Strong points
//todo

## Weak points and bugs
- Confroid:
1. the frontend is very basic
2. to view a configuration that is too long, you must first click on the "edit" button
3. import from server is a simulation due to the fact that the server is fictitious (not connected to the web)
4. if you decide to use a service offered by the server and log in, you must choose the service you want to use again
