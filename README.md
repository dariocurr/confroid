# Confroid
## About the project

### Introduction
Our project consists of two applications:
- *Confroid*:
is an app that manages files, more specifically
has the task to export or import configuration files from the device or from a server.
- *Shopping*:
is an app where to insert data relating to purchases, 
has the task of creating those configuration files through entered personal data by an user.

## Strong points
1. the use of API
2. high security due to the fact that a malicious user cannot modify the data of other users thanks to token authentication

## Weak points and bugs
1. the frontend is very basic
2. to view a configuration that is too long, you must first click on the "edit" button (Confroid)
3. import from server is a simulation due to the fact that the server is not connected to the web (Confroid)
